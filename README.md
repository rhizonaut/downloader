# downloader
Downloads things from the web

## Idea
- Urls contain media
- Different urls contain different media
- A url can be analysed and media extracted
- One program can be used to analyze any url and download media from it

***Someday in the future users will have only one interface fulfilling all their downloading demands***

The tool can be used in building chat bots or websites or else interfaces allowing users to easily download media from the web. 

## Supported sources
By now the tool can download:
- Youtube's audio and video
- Bandcamp's tracks and albums
- Url's files

## State
Very raw in development
